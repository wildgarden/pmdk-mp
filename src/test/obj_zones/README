#README for obj_zones

The expected allocations were changed due to the following reasons:

## original implemenation
expected 508 allocations.
The test creates a file with 64G.

This translates to
64 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 67108864 kb.
A chunk has 256kb.

Thus, we have 262144 total chunks.
MAX_CHUNK per zone is 65528 chunks.

We have a total of 4.0005 zones.

We allocate 128mb == 131072 kb.
131072 / 256 = 512 chunks.

Allocated by obj are 513 units(chunks).

Thus, we have 65528 / 513 = 127.7349 possible allocations per zone.

127 * 4 (Zones) = 508 expected allocations.

## multiprocess support with regions
65528 / 16 (regions) = 4095.5 chunks per region.

4095/513 (chunks per allocation) = 7.9834

This results in 7 * 16 = 112 possible allocations of size 128mb.

112 * 4 (zones) = 448 expected allocations.

The difference is not lost, because it can still be used for allocations with smaller size.

Note: the max allocation size per zone is 4095 * 256 kb = 1048320 kb = 1023.75 mb
